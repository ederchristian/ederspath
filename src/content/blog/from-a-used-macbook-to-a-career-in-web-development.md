description: Inspired by Apple, from a junior dev in São Paulo, Brazil, to a career in tech focused on code and automation.
---

I started programming because of Apple.

Growing up in a modest family, I got my first computer at 19. Years later, instead of getting a driver's license, I saved up and bought a used MacBook Air 11-inch from a college friend. I was mesmerized by Apple and decided to learn to code.

In 2017, I left my small town and moved to Sao Paulo without a place to stay—but holding a junior developer position in an education startup. That same year, I started learning English. By 2018, I visited Silicon Valley for the first time. In 2020, I became a partner at the startup. By 2022, I had started working at Automatiq remotely, an American company based in New York (the number 1 automation platform powering ticket resale).

This March, I experienced the Apple Vision Pro for the first time in Cupertino, California. The incredible sensation of this technology, which will only improve, marked my first VR experience.

Looking back at this journey, I'm reminded of how privileged I am to work in tech, with great people, and impact many lives through code.

And this is just the beginning.
