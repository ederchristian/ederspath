- Ask specific questions
- “How am I doing?” is not helpful
- Ask instead, for example:

  - Is there something I could have done for [task] better? What areas do you think I could improve upon?
  - Do you have any suggestions for how I can take on more responsibility or expand my role?
  - What goals or objectives should I focus on in the upcoming months?
  - How do you gain visibility into my work?

## Asking for help (without triggering Imposter Syndrome)#

### How

- Timeboxing

## Treat each Q&A session as an opportunity to build trust#

- Show your due diligence
- Collaborate on a final solution
  - Never say “I need help”.
  - Say “Hey, I tried this, which resulted to this. Here are the other things I tried, and then this is what happened. Now this is my hypothesis, but I ran out of time. What do you think about that?
- Clarify assumptions
- Express gratitude
